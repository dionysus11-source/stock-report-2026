# Change: Add Project README and Setup Scripts

## Why
The project lacks clear instructions for new developers or users to set up and run the application. Providing a comprehensive guide and automation scripts will improve onboarding experience.

## What Changes
- Add a detailed `README.md` with preconditions, installation, and execution guides.
- Create a `setup.py` script to automate dependency installation for both backend and frontend.
- Provide `run_app.py` as the primary entry point for starting the application.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `documentation` (NEW)
- Affected code: `README.md`, `setup.py`, `run_app.py`
